I'm a Senior Product Designer at [Hudl](http://hudl.com).

For the past two years I was lead designer on Hudl's efforts to create a [unified video experience](/hudl-video-experience/) for its disparate platforms.

Before that, I designed our first [suite of basketball tools](/hudl-basketball/).

Last year I also wrote a library of React components that's being used by nearly two dozen of our dev teams.

I don't really freelance anymore, but earlier this year I spent a little time helping a former employer [rethink their homepage](/ssrc-homepage/).

### Former lives

I was Product Director at [Amara](http://amara.org) for a couple years, leading a six-person product team and working with clients like Netflix and TED.

Before that I was Project Lead for Symphony, an open source CMS. I coded lots, wrote a ton of documentation (and most of a book!), and designed [getsymphony.com](http://getsymphony.com)â€”which won the McFarlane Prize at Web Directions in 2010.
